# Session 1 Takehome — Deep Platform Analysis

## What to Do After the Session

### 1. Run the Full Assessment (15 min)
```bash
python3 design-principles-checklist.py ../demo/platform-config.yaml
```
Evaluate your platform against the 12 design principles from the book.
Document which ones you pass and which ones need work.

### 2. Survey Your Developers (30 min setup)
```bash
python3 devex-survey.py
```
Customize the survey questions for your org and send to 5-10 developers.
Collect responses over 1 week.

### 3. Analyze Friction Points (15 min)
```bash
python3 friction-analyzer.py --workflow onboarding
```
Map your developer journey and identify the top 3 friction points.

### 4. Establish Your Baseline KPIs (15 min)
```bash
python3 platform-kpi-collector.py
```
Record your current metrics. You'll compare against these at 30/60/90 days.

## Deliverable
Write a 1-page "Platform State of the Union" for your team:
- Current maturity score (from assessment)
- Top 3 friction points (from analyzer)
- Proposed first golden path
