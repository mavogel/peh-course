# Building an AI-Powered Internal Developer Platform from Scratch

A hands-on, 2-day workshop by [Ajay Chankramath](mailto:ajay@platformetrics.com), author of *The Platform Engineer's Handbook* (Packt, 2026).

**Register:** [Eventbrite - Building an AI-Powered Internal Developer Platform from Scratch](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/building-an-ai-powered-internal-developer-platform-from-scratch-tickets-1978960034736)

### Companion Resources

This course is based on *The Platform Engineer's Handbook*. The book covers the full breadth of platform engineering across 14 chapters, including tools like ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts, OpenCost, and more that go beyond what we can cover in two days. The course distills the book's core concepts into a hands-on, buildable platform you can take home.

## What This Course Is About

Most platform engineering content stops at theory. This workshop starts from an empty terminal and walks you through every layer of an Internal Developer Platform — from cluster provisioning and infrastructure-as-code through developer portals, observability, chaos engineering, and AI-powered operations. Over two days (4 hours each, 9 sessions), you'll build and run each component hands-on, understand how they connect, and leave with working code you can extend at your own pace.

No cloud accounts required. No vendor lock-in. Everything runs locally on Kubernetes (Kind), uses open-source tools, and is designed so you can take what you build straight back to your team. For the complete platform engineering journey across all 14 chapters, see [*The Platform Engineer's Handbook*](https://peh-packt.platformetrics.com/).

### What You'll Walk Away With

- A Kind cluster configured with team namespaces, RBAC roles, and resource quotas — the multi-tenant foundation of any IDP
- Crossplane XRDs and Compositions that turn database provisioning into a 10-line developer claim
- Backstage software templates, service catalog configuration, and a project bootstrapper that scaffolds production-ready services
- An OpenTelemetry Collector pipeline with Prometheus metrics, Jaeger tracing, Loki logging, and SLO definitions using Sloth
- Canary and blue-green deployment manifests with an automated rollback controller
- Chaos Mesh experiments (network delay, pod kill, pod failure) that test resilience before users find the gaps
- AI-powered automation scripts: RAG doc search (runs locally, no API key), multi-agent incident response, alert correlation, and governance alerts
- A personal 30/60/90-day platform adoption roadmap based on your maturity assessment

> **Course vs. Book:** This workshop introduces each layer of the platform with working code and hands-on exercises. *The Platform Engineer's Handbook* goes deeper — covering production GitOps with ArgoCD, advanced progressive delivery with Argo Rollouts, cost management with OpenCost, and more across 14 chapters. The course is the starting point; the book is the complete reference.

### Who Should Attend

Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineers, SREs, Infrastructure Engineers, Engineering Managers, AI/ML Engineers building internal tooling, and anyone responsible for developer productivity.

## Tech Stack

The course standardizes on one tool per job to keep setup simple and eliminate "which tool should I use?" decisions. Everything below is open source and runs locally.

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Container Runtime** | Docker Desktop | Runs containers locally |
| **Kubernetes** | Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) | Local multi-node clusters |
| **Package Manager** | Helm | Installs Crossplane, Prometheus, Chaos Mesh into the cluster |
| **IaC / Provisioning** | Pulumi (Python SDK) | Cluster and resource provisioning |
| **Resource Abstraction** | Crossplane | Self-service XRDs, Compositions, Claims |
| **Policy Engine** | OPA / Conftest / Gatekeeper | Policy-as-Code, shift-left validation |
| **Git Hooks** | pre-commit | Shift-left validation on every commit |
| **Developer Portal** | Backstage | Service catalog, software templates, docs |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Reusable workflow pipelines |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry Collector | Unified telemetry collection |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus + Sloth | Metrics, SLO-driven alerting |
| **Tracing** | Jaeger | Distributed tracing |
| **Logging** | Loki | Log aggregation |
| **Autoscaling** | HPA / VPA | Horizontal and Vertical Pod Autoscaling |
| **Chaos Engineering** | Chaos Mesh | Fault injection experiments |
| **Progressive Delivery** | Canary / Blue-Green | Built-in deployment manifests with rollback controller |
| **Backup & Recovery** | Velero | Cluster backup and restore |
| **AI / LLM** | Anthropic Claude (optional) | RAG, multi-agent incident response |
| **AI (Local / No API Key)** | TF-IDF (scikit-learn) | Local doc search, alert correlation |
| **Web Framework** | Flask | Self-service onboarding API |
| **Language** | Python 3 | All scripts and automation |

> **Note on AI features:** Every AI demo has a local-only fallback (TF-IDF, heuristics) that runs without any API key. Claude integration is optional for those who want to explore LLM-powered capabilities.

> **Looking for ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts, OpenCost, or other tools?** The book covers a broader set of tools across 14 chapters. See the [book repo](https://github.com/achankra/peh) for the full stack. This course focuses on the subset you can build and run in two days.
